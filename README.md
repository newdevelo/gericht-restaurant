<p align="left">I just had the chance to use React and CSS to create a restaurant landing page website. I didn't need JavaScript or animation to build a contemporary and interesting website because I had access to such potent tools.<br><br>The ability to generate reusable functional components is one of React's main benefits. I was able to streamline the development process and provide a more modular design by disassembling the page into smaller components.<br><br><br>In terms of CSS, I put a lot of emphasis on leveraging basic CSS elements like flex and grid to make a responsive and aesthetically pleasing layout. This eliminated the need for complicated media queries and made it simple for me to change the layout according to the screen size.<br><br>I also paid significant attention to font, space, and color to guarantee a wonderful user experience. I was able to make a unified design that was both aesthetically pleasing and simple to read by employing a consistent color scheme and typeface.<br><br>I selected a contemporary, minimalist style that was both aesthetically pleasing and simple to use. In order to guarantee that the most crucial text was prominently shown, significant consideration of space, layout, and visual hierarchy was required.</p>
